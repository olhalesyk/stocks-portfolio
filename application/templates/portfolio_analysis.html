        <p class="text-lg font-light text-secondary pb-2">The correlation coefficient, which measures the strength and
            direction of a linear relationship between two variables,
            played a crucial role in this selection process. I calculated the correlation coefficients for the stock
            prices of each
            company pair over a specified period.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-light text-secondary pb-2">My goal was to find companies whose stock price movements were
            less
            correlated
            with each other, aiming to diversify and minimize risk.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-light text-secondary pb-8">After thorough analysis, I chose the four companies that
            demonstrated lower correlation coefficients with each other
            while maintaining strong individual performance metrics. This strategic selection ensures a balanced and
            diversified
            investment portfolio, reducing the potential risk associated with market fluctuations.</p>
